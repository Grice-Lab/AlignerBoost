<b>AlignerBoost</b> is a generalized software toolkit for boosting Next-Gen sequencing mapping precision
using a Bayesian based mapping quality framework. 

AlignerBoost works with any NGS aligners that can produce standard SAM/BAM alignment outputs,
i.e. Bowtie, Bowtie2, BWA, SOAP2, YOABS, YA, and also supports RNA-seq aligners (i.e. Tophat/Tophat2, STAR). 

AlignerBoost works by tuning NGS aligners to report all potential alignments,
then utilizes a Bayesian-based framework to accurately estimate the mapping quality
of ambiguously mapped reads.

AlignerBoost can dramatically increase mapping precision without a significant loss of
sensitivity under various experimental strategies.


AlignerBoost is SNP-aware, and higher quality alignments can be achieved if provided with known SNPs.
